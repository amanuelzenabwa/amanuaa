    Amanuel  Degife a twenty years old adult 
    from green and beautiful southern part of 
    Ethiopia. I reflect varied a personality including 
    ambitious, the qualities of  generous and thoughtfulness and 
    oddly carelessness. I am also a well determined and vigorous
     individual, yet pleasantly calm. I fight for what I desire and 
     believe  in, and doing it through God because nothing great comes east with God everything is possible. 
    I am fully time student, motivated by my love for learning and 
    succeeding as I strived to become outstanding and successful man in 
    todayâ€™s society. From highschool to the university I was always attracted
     to the construction industry especially in architecture designing. And for that matter I 
     joined EIABC campus to study architecture. I have a dream to be a productive architect. 
     The country is not that much advanced in this area. By standing with this generation I will do may best to do a meaningful influence in this industry.
